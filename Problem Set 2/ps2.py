# Problem 2: Building up the Campus Map
#
# Problem 2a: Designing your graph
#
# What do the graph's nodes represent in this problem? What
# do the graph's edges represent? Where are the distances
# represented?
#
# Answer: graph presents by a dictionary where keys are node object (not just node name). Value of each key will be edges
